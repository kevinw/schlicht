## To Do

- Example: Keyboard input
- Example: Gamepad input
- Exmaple: Spritesheet 
- Use same Shader code for text and primitive shader or use unique structs for both
- Add scaling methods like godot has, keep_width etc
- Rework Spritesheet usage maybe
- Unified input into odin enums from glfw
- rework mouse inputs to be somewhat like keyboard input

## In Progress

- text rendering
- bring shaders into code as strings so they aren't file dependant so you don't have to keep a copy

## Done

- upload to github
